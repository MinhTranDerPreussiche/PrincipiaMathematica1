    <h1>What are proofs?</h1>
    <p>
        A proof is a logical argument that demonstrates the truth of a mathematical statement by deriving it from accepted axioms and previously established theorems using a sequence of deductive reasoning steps.</p>
        <p>
            In other words, proofs verify ideas in math to show that they are true</p>
