    <h1>Triangle Theorems</h1>
    <p>Explore the fundamental theorems that govern the properties and relationships of triangles.</p>

    <h2>Triangle Similarity Theorems</h2>
    <p>Two triangles are similar if their corresponding angles are equal and their corresponding sides are proportional. This is established through several theorems:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>AA (Angle-Angle):</strong> If two angles of one triangle are congruent to two angles of another triangle, the triangles are similar.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS (Side-Angle-Side):</strong> If one angle of a triangle is equal to one angle of another triangle, and the sides including these angles are proportional, then the triangles are similar.</li>
        <li><strong>SSS (Side-Side-Side):</strong> If the corresponding sides of two triangles are proportional, then the triangles are similar.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Triangle Congruence Theorems</h2>
    <p>Two triangles are congruent if all corresponding sides and angles are equal. The following theorems are used to prove congruence:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>SSS (Side-Side-Side):</strong> If three sides of one triangle are equal to three sides of another triangle, they are congruent.</li>
        <li><strong>SAS (Side-Angle-Side):</strong> If two sides and the included angle of one triangle are equal to two sides and the included angle of another triangle, they are congruent.</li>
        <li><strong>ASA (Angle-Side-Angle):</strong> If two angles and the included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and the included side of another triangle, they are congruent.</li>
        <li><strong>AAS (Angle-Angle-Side):</strong> If two angles and a non-included side of one triangle are equal to two angles and a corresponding non-included side of another triangle, they are congruent.</li>
    </ul>


    <h2>Pythagorean Theorem</h2>
    <p>The Pythagorean theorem states that in a right-angled triangle, the square of the length of the hypotenuse is equal to the sum of the squares of the other two sides.</p>

    <h2>Triangle Inequality Theorem</h2>
    <p>The triangle inequality theorem states that the sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle must be greater than the length of the third side.</p>
